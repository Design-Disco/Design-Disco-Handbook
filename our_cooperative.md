# Our Organization



In this section, you can find out [some of our history](history.html), and why we chose to become a not-for-profit organization.

We have a [fierce commitment to our values](purpose_and_vision.html), which is reflected in all the choices we make, from the legal structure, to [our daily working practices](working_together.html), how we look after our volunteers and manage employment, to financing.
