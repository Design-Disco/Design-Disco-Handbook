# Coordination at Design Disco

Coordination in Design Disco is extremely imporant. As a non-profit organization of mostly volunteers, we are in need of extremely clear coordination in order for things to go smoothly. 

The coordination of projects is handled by a Project leader who is assigned to every project we do. It is very important for project leaders to coordinate clearly, and including all important parties in the channels of communication. 

The use of a shared google calendar makes the coordination between many individuals easier, and more clear. This google calendar can be accessed by all Design Disco members.
