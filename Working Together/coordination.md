# Coordination at Design Disco

Coordination in Design Disco is extremely imporant. As a non-profit organization of mostly volunteers, we are in need of extremely clear coordination in order for things to go smoothly. 

The coordination of projects is handled by the project leader. One is assigned to every project, and it is their responsability to see that everything is carried out as needed, they do not necisarily need to do the work themselves, but rather must keep track of of the big picture, so that each task can be succesffuly carried out by project members. It is very important for project leaders to coordinate clearly, and include all important parties in the channels of communication. Namely using Slack, however also on email and in person. 

The use of a shared google calendar makes the coordination between many individuals easier, and more clear. This google calendar can be accessed by all Design Disco members.
