# Project Teams

Design Disco members are split up into project teams depending on what we are working on and what they are interested in. Everyone has the freedom to join and leave any project team if they wish. The teams last as long as the project they are involved in, and once they have completed the project, they will join other teams, or recombine for new projects. 

This way, everyone has the freedome to work on what they are interested in, and we can constantly change according to what work there is at hand.
