# Marketing tools

{ we should add our own marketing tools in here - like link tracking }


**all loomio stuff bellow:**

## Assets

Youâ€™ll find brand assets like screenshots, logos, and illustrations [in the Loomio brand assets folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0By3lxDcQiC3Oc29SYjA1MkVkXzA). Please keep these organised so we can quickly produce new marketing collateral - talk to Rich if you have questions.

Image files are named descriptively, including the width in pixels, like loomio-mobile-content\_394.png

## Link tracking

To start with at least, we're going to be very granular with our link tracking. [This article](https://github.com/simontegg/marketing/wiki/Marketing-Analytics) is a good introduction to UTM link tracking. [This is the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zP3jNePhTSzmDoTK2yHoQwdHxD5jyXN311IQli2JtPs/edit#gid=0) for building our UTM links:

The first page is the **content distribution link** generator. So when we have a new blog post, we'll use a unique link to share it on Facebook, and another one on Twitter.

The second page is the **internal link** generator. So the call to action at the bottom of the blog post will have this link on it.

This way we can run a single campaign across lots of different channels and see how they perform relative to each other.

In Google Analytics, go to Acquisition -&gt; Campaigns -&gt; All Campaigns to see how all the campaigns are performing.
