# Planning

## Annual

We do annual planning so everyone is focused on the same thing, and all the different areas of our work add up to a coherent and coordinated whole.

### 2017 Plan

- become a non-profit organization in CZ
- minamum one outreach per month 
- one fully completed afterschool program
- write a handbook together
- introduce retreats

## Quarterly

Every quarter, we have an away day (preceded and followed by various preparation and workshops), where we take stock of where we are relative to our overall vision, annual plan, and emerging reality, and decide what to focus on for the coming 3 months. This allows us to update our understanding of our annual plan as we learn more, and the world changes, and adjust course accordingly.

Quarterly plans take a range of forms, depending on the circumstances and needs of the team. Usually we end up with a more in-depth document, accompanied by an easily accessible summary.

The goal is to provide a guiding focus for all our work across the team. Because we give individuals a lot of autonomy and don't micro-manage, we need to agree some themes and shared goals to have collective impact. If we try to do everything, we're likely to be distracted and stretched too thin. But we like to name ambitious goals to motivate ourselves.
