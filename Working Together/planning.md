# Planning

Each Year we set out goals to work towards, in order the have a direction and unifying point of focus in our work. 

On the last Tuesday of each month, we have whole team meetings in order to review recent workshops, outreaches, etc... as well as state upcoming events. This is a process of reviewing our work as well, in order to understand how we are doing in regards to our anual goals.
