# Swimming in the Ocean of Internal Communications

**all this bellow is loomio:**
We are a non project organization of mostly volunteers with full time schedules, which means we need to communicate and coordinate a lot. This only works by operating in a high-communication environment.

All staff have access to pretty much everything, and anyone can share their insights and expertise. By swimming in information, we maximise our collective intelligence. But sometimes that high volume of information can be overwhelming and it starts to feel more like drowning than swimming.

We are constantly trying to imporove our communication tools and systems, but we’re making it up as we go along. You’re at least as smart as anyone else here, so if you’ve got something you want to offer don’t wait for permission - just get started and pitch in.

## Slack is our main communication tool

Slack is a really nice tool we use for day-to-day real-time chat. And all project related communication! It is highly important for everyone to use it and check it regularly. 

You’ll automatically be in the \#general channel, which is for everyone. You can also join other channels if you want to see what’s going on in the teams. You can send direct messages to anyone, which is great if you’ve just got a quick question that you want an immediate answer to. You can "star" the channels you want to keep up with and they will stick to the top of the list.

It can be really helpful to stay logged into Slack whenever you’re at your computer, so that if someone has a quick question for you, you are easily contactable. It’s not desirable or healthy for everyone to be contactable at all times, but the more you can be logged in to Slack, the more frictionless our daily comms can be.

## Google Apps

We use the Google Apps Suite, this gives you access to all the other tools, like Drive, Docs, Calendar, etc.

### Drive for collaborative documents

We use collaborative documents all the time. Google Drive handles our word processing, spreadsheets, presentations, and file storage.

### Calendar for scheduling

We use Google Calendar for coordinating everything. We recomend using the phone app to make it easier. Inside the calendar, each member has a calendar for their name, where they can mark important dates they are away or busy on. And then there are calendars for meetings, workshops dates, etc...

## Asking for help

If you have a question about something you’re working on, you can talk to a project leader. Use the slack channels that are apropriet whenever your question might help others as well, otherwise direct messages are sufficient.
