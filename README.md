## The Design Disco Handbook

Here are notes, links and an intro to writing an Open Source handbook.

Why Open Source?

Collective knowledge is greater than that of any invidividual. People who write rules are more likely to follow them. People who do not follow rules usually have a reason and it is always worth finding that out. When you give people the oportunity to be responsible they will rise to the ocasion. And an open Handbook can constantly change and evolve so that it does not become stale and outdated.

"How we see people is how we treat them, and how we treat them is who they become" -Johann Wolfgang von Goethe
