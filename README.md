## The Design Disco Handbook
Design Disco is a group of people who do things. Ra raa ra ra ra.


[TAKEN FROM WEBSITE] 
_Design Disco is a non-profit design education organization based in Prague, Czech Republic geared towards high school students. Run by young designers, we host various short-term and long-term design programs to inspire creativity to the younger generation. Our instructors come from various backgrounds in design: architecture, landscape architecture, graphic design, architecture theory, product design, and web design._

_Design Disco was formed in 2014 by ARCHIP students Jason and Ben, who shared the same belief that young people from all backgrounds ‚Äî not just those who can afford it ‚Äî should have equal access to discover their creative potential, empowering them to incorporate design into their academic pursuits and everyday lives._ _
