# The Design Disco Handbook

Design Disco is a group of people who do things.

Design Disco is a non-profit design education organization based in Prague, Czech Republic geared towards high school students. Run by young designers, we host various short-term and long-term design programs to inspire creativity to the younger generation. Our instructors come from various backgrounds in design: architecture, landscape architecture, graphic design, architecture theory, product design, and web design.


## About this handbook
