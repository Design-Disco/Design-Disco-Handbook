# Looking after people

{ I think we can basically agree with most of this stuff, right? }





**What loomio wrote bellow:**

We have a huge emphasis on looking after people. We've learnt that when people are feeling happy and well, they do great work.

Whether it is the daily question, 'what are you doing for your wellbeing today?' or a night out with the team, we focus on enhancing the vibe.

Our members have the autonomy and collective trust to work in whatever way they feel makes them, and the people around them, most productive. We recognise that some unavoidable aspects of life affect wellbeing and can make productivity more difficult, such as menstruation. We encourage workers to speak to their wellbeing as much as makes them comfortable. We actively seek to disrupt the stigma around taboo aspects of physical health, and mental health, and make accommodations for them.

Here is a nice article written about what it's like [working in a caring organisation](https://medium.com/enspiral-tales/a-caring-organisation-5319f81c420f#.11angmlxu).
